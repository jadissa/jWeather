## Why
Forecast.io died and I needed a weather monitor replacement. 

## Thanks
This project is based on: https://github.com/nickroberts/geektool-forecast.io-weather

## Requirements
PHP, GeekTool, WeatherAPI account (yes, it is free)

## How
Note:
- Requires GeekTool, which can be downloaded from https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/
- Requires a weather API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/

- Register App for use at weatherapi.com
- Generate your API key
- Paste your API key and other configs into a .env file in the root of this project:
```
# Weather Options
WEATHERAPI_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxx"
IMAGE_DIRECTORY="images"
DAYS_TO_FETCH=3
FONT_FAMILY="fonts/fontx.lel"
FONT_COLOR="#c64fff"
FONT_SIZE=35
# c or f
HEAT_UNIT="f"
# kpm or mph
SPEED_UNIT="mph"
PRECISION=1
LATITUDE="xxxxxxxxx"
LONGITUDE="yyyyyyyy"
TIME_ZONE="America/Los_Angeles"
APP_LOCALE=en
DEMO_SESH=false
```

- Open GeekTool

#### Enable Weather Generation Method 1
- Drag new 'Shell' Geeklet to your desktop
- Paste the following line into the Shell Command:
```/path/to/php /path/to/jWeather/artisan weather:generate-image```

Notes:
- The following command can show you the path to your php install:
```which php```
- You can disable the output by checking override text and setting the value to a space in GT

- Set the command to run every 3,600 seconds
- Set Timeout to something such as 20 seconds
- Check Display status feedback image
- In your terminal, run ```/path/to/php /path/to/jWeather/artisan weather:generate-image``` to generate the weather display, if necessary or to test

#### Enable Weather Generation Method 2 ( optional )
Note:
- This only applies if you chose to not do method 1

- Create a cron entry in your system for the weather script to run:
- In your terminal, run ```crontab -e```
- Paste the following into your crontab:
- ```0 * * * * /path/to/php /path/to/jWeather/artisan weather:generate-image```

#### Enable Weather Display
- Drag new 'Image' Geeklet to your desktop
- Set local path to: ```/path/to/jWeather/public/images/out.png```

- Resize the 'Image' window to desired size by dragging the bottom right corner
- Set to run every every 2 seconds or no more than 3600 seconds
- At this point, you should be set!

## Platforms
Any Mac system that has php installed

## FAQ
- You can change size of font in your .evn, along with other settings
- The reason this project requires MacOS is because I'm not aware of another way besides GeekTool to easily place an image on your desktop in a certain position. You could technically try alternatives to solve this, as I'm sure they exist
- You may need to run ```/path/to/php /path/to/jWeather/artisan weather:generate-image``` to see those changes immediately

## Issues
https://github.com/jadissa/jWeather/issues
- If the weather API ever stops working, weather.gov currently provides a free service and this code could be updated to support that API instead: https://api.weather.gov/
